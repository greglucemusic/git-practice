                <h4>Don't feel like an idiot!</h4>
                <p>When you just started a new skill or vocation, it is ALWAYS going to take time. Yes, learning is sometimes crammed down your throat in huge chunks, but you can take the time to go back over what you have learned. You are NOT going to know everything the first time around.</p>

                <h4>Practice. Rinse. Repeat.</h4>
                <p>Have you ever learned a new musical instrument or tried practicing a new language? Trust me, it does not work by osmosis! The best thing to do to learn your coding skills is to take what you have mastered, add a new skill, and work it until it WORKS!</p>
